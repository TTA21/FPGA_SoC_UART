# FPGA_SoC_UART

  This UART module can be used to transmitt 8 bits[1 byte] of data per request, it is expected to use it in conjunction to another module's state machine to send multiple bytes.
  The reciever odule has a log wich can be used to read previous recieved bytes until overwriten.
  
  Many thanks to TONI [ https://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniusSimplus ] for teaching me how to make this component, since his github does not have the source files anymore , i've decided to upload my own.
