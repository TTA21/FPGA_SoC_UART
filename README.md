# FPGA_SoC_UART

  This UART module can be used to transmitt 8 bits[1 byte] of data per request, it is expected to use it in conjunction to another module's state machine to send multiple bytes.
  The module only recieves readable chars and not commands, to change that just read the main component's details.
  
  Many thanks to TONI [ https://www.youtube.com/user/AntoniusSimplus ] for teaching me how to make this component, since his github does not have the source files anymore , i've decided to upload my own.
